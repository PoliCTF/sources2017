Bill is a computer science student
Bill managed to lock himself out of his own vps again
Bill remembers on the server is still running a small program he wrote to understand RMI, and that to get it working he
blindly copypasted snippets from stackoverflow and it's professors slides
Maybe there's still hope of getting the flag he left there.
Please help Bill
